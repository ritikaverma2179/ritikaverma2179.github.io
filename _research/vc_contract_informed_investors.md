excerpt: '*Abstract: A cashless entrepreneur designs a contract backed by future cash flows to raise funds from an informed investor. The entrepreneur can exert effort to improve future outcomes, but the marginal benefit of costly effort depends on the quality of the project, where the quality is the private information of the investor. This paper investigates the optimal contract that the entrepreneur proposes to the investor to maximize her own expected payoff by minimizing agency rent. I show that a trade-off in the surplus maximization of projects of different qualities emerges, and the optimal contract is a bang-bang solution as it varies discontinuously with the prior beliefs of the entrepreneur, making her risk-seeking in the menu options. Furthermore, the optimal separating contract is inefficient for intermediate prior beliefs. The results are then applied to predict the effect of divergence in the subjective beliefs of the entrepreneur and the true prior in the economy on the outcome of the project and overall innovation in the economy.*

A cashless entrepreneur designs a contract backed by future cash flows to raise funds from an informed investor. The entrepreneur can exert effort to improve future outcomes, but the marginal benefit of costly effort depends on the quality of the project, where the quality is the private information of the investor. This paper investigates the optimal contract that the entrepreneur proposes to the investor to maximize her own expected payoff by minimizing agency rent. I show that a trade-off in the surplus maximization of projects of different qualities emerges, and the optimal contract is a bang-bang solution as it varies discontinuously with the prior beliefs of the entrepreneur, making her risk-seeking in the menu options. Furthermore, the optimal separating contract is inefficient for intermediate prior beliefs. The results are then applied to predict the effect of divergence in the subjective beliefs of the entrepreneur and the true prior in the economy on the outcome of the project and overall innovation in the economy.
