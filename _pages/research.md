    * [Venture Capital Contracts with Informed Investors](https://nyu.box.com/s/lznuzdzi2p7izyylsy4a9xiu4qbx5d4s)
      * *Abstract: A cashless entrepreneur designs a contract backed by future cash flows to raise funds from
                    an informed investor. The entrepreneur can exert costly effort to improve payoff relevant out-
                    come where the marginal benefit depends on the quality of the project. The quality of the
                    project is observed privately by the investors. This study investigates the optimal contract
                    that an entrepreneur proposes to an investor given these two specific information frictions. In
                    equilibrium, a trade-off emerges between the surplus maximization of projects of different qual-
                    ities. In particular, this tradeoff creates an endogenous preference for risk by the entrepreneur
                    when designing the menu of contracts. The results are applied to predict the effect of diver-
                    gence in the entrepreneur’s subjective beliefs on the project’s outcome and overall efficiency in
                    the economy.*
